Add report tooling (similar to `pipetask report`, but faster) to the `ProvenanceQuantumGraph` class and the `butler` command line (as the new `provenance-report` subcommand).

Update `butler ingest-graph` to delete now-empty config/metadata/log directories.

Fix a bug that causes provenance quantum graphs to fail to be written if the address file grew to larger than 2G.
