Add `PredictedQuantumGraph`, a replacement for the `QuantumGraph` class with more efficient I/O (via a new file format and more partial-read flexibility).

The new `PredictedQuantumGraph` is now the default in most tooling, and the new format can be opted into via the `.qg` (instead of `.qgraph`) file extension.
New files can be read with the old class and vice versa.

The new `QuantumGraph` will eventually be deprecated along with much of the current provenance reporting tooling, but only when the new provenance ecosystem is fully in place.
