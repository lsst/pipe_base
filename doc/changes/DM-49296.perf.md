QuantumGraph generation has been partially rewritten to support building larger graphs and build all graphs faster.

With this change, QuantumGraph generation no longer uses a long-lived temporary table in the butler database for followup queries, and instead uploads a set of data IDs to the database for each query.
In addition, the algorithm for adding nodes and edges from the data ID query results has been reworked to duplicate irrelevant dimensions earlier, making it much faster.
