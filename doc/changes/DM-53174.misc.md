Use UUIDs instead of internal integer IDs in new quantum graph storage.

This includes backwards compatibility read support for predicted quantum graphs,
but not provenance quantum graphs, because those are still experimental anyway.

This increases the size of the files by ~6%, but it simplifies the codebase and
will make consolidating multiple small provenance quantum graphs (as we
currently anticipate doing for prompt processing) much more efficient.
