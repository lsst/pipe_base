Add `PipelineTask.select` and and `PipelineTask.select_tasks`, which use a small custom expression language to select subsets of a pipeline.

This functionality is intended to eventually be made available on the `pipetask` command-line and possibly in `Pipeline` YAML definitions, but this change just adds it to the `PipelineGraph` Python interface while design work continues on making it available more broadly.
