    Notes
    -----
    Using a tuple for the key allows tasks labels and dataset type names with
    the same string value to coexist in the graph.  These only rarely appear in
    `PipelineGraph` public interfaces; when the node type is implicit, bare
    `str` task labels or dataset type names are used instead.

    NodeKey objects stringify to just their name, which is used both as a way
    to convert to the `str` objects used in the main public interface and as an
    easy way to usefully stringify containers returned directly by networkx
    algorithms (especially in error messages).  Note that this requires `repr`,
    not just `str`, because Python builtin containers always use `repr` on
    their items, even in their implementations for `str`.
