"""Tools for generating Sphinx documentation from Pipeline definitions.

The tools in this module were first developed as something to be run by the
SCons build system, generating files that are later used in ``documenteer``
builds, but it was designed to be usable from other Python code as well (e.g.
some future version of ``documenteer`` itself).  See
`PackagePipelinesDocBuilder.scons_generate` for notes on how interfacing with a
SCons build works, as a few quirks of SCons' behavior need to be worked around.

    takes a sequence of `TaskDef` (the result of a call to

    files are generated for the pipeline as well as each of its tasks,
    referencing that content.

    Transforming ``.dot`` files into images is not handled directly by this
    class; it merely manages the paths to those rendered diagrams.  See

    invoke the ``dot`` tool to do this.

        Yields
        ------
        node : `SCons.Node.Node`
            An SCons build node for a documentation file generated by this
            class.

        Notes
        -----
        SCons is Python-based, but it makes a strong distinction between code
        that is run when its scripts are merely executed vs. code that runs
        when targets are actually built.  This method is an example of the
        former; it yields SCon objects that run this module on the command-line
        via ``python -m`` to achieve the latter.  It would be more natural to
        just instantiate a `PackagePipelinesDocBuilder` once, and then invoke
        each of its nested `PipelineDocBuilder` instances and call
        `write_index_rst` directly, but this isn't possible for two reasons:

        - In parallel builds (i.e. ``scons -j``) the (apparent) use of
          multithreading causes problems with (apparent) globals in reading and
          expanding `Pipelines`.  By making each action a separate command-line
          invocation, we ensure they are run in their own processes.

        - SCons executes its `SConscript` files with the current directory set
          to the directory that `SConscript` file is in, but then builds
          targets with the `SConstruct` directory current; it really wants
          actions that depend on paths to utilize the targets and sources they
          are passed (which are corrected for this shift) instead of
          remembering them internally (as this class and those nested within it
          do).  To work around this, we use relative paths in the script phase
          (constructing a `PackagePipelinesDocBuilder` and calling this method)
          so SCons can correctly reason about dependencies, and then passing
          absolute paths on the command-line so the change of working directory
          is relevant.

        Examples
        --------
        Usage in a ``doc/SConscript`` file, where ``lsst.drp.pipe`` is the
        name of the package, and the environment object and management of
        top-level tarets comes from `lsst.sconsUtils`::

            from lsst.sconsUtils.state import env, targets
            from pathlib import Path
            from lsst.pipe.base.pipeline_doc_builder import (
                PackagePipelinesDocBuilder
            )

            target_root = Path(str(env.Dir("lsst.drp.pipe/pipelines")))
            artifacts = list(
                PackagePipelinesDocBuilder.from_source(
                    Path(str(env.Dir("#pipelines"))),
                    rst_root=target_root,
                    pipeline_root=target_root,
                    dot_root=target_root,
                    graph_root=target_root,
                    rst_path=Path(str(env.File("lsst.drp.pipe/pipelines_index.rst"))),
                ).scons_generate(env)
            )

            env.AlwaysBuild(artifacts)
            env.Clean("doc", artifacts)

            targets["doc"].extend(artifacts)

        We use ``AlwaysBuild`` because SCons has no way of knowing when some
        modification to an upstream configuration file or pipeline ``yaml``
        ingredient file could change the outputs, so it is safest to rebuild
        whenever ``scons`` is run.
