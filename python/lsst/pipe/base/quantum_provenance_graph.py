        is difficult to discern. There are a few specific ways to enter a wonky
        state; it is impossible to exit and requires human intervention to
        proceed with processing.
        Currently, a quantum enters a wonky state for one of three reasons:
        - Its overall `QuantumInfoStatus` moves from a successful state (as a
        result of a successful run) to any other state. In other words,
        something that initially succeeded fails on subsequent attempts.
        - A `QuantumRun` is missing logs.
        - There are multiple runs associated with a dataset, and this comes up
          in a findFirst search. This means that a dataset which will be used
          as an input data product for further processing has heterogeneous
          inputs, which may have had different inputs or a different
          data-query.
    FAILED = -2: These quanta were attempted and failed. Failed quanta have
        logs and no metadata.
    UNKNOWN = -1: These are quanta which do not have any metadata associated
        with processing, but for which it is impossible to tell the status due

        conceptualized in the construction of the quantum graph but later

    BLOCKED = 0: The quantum is not able to execute because its inputs are

    qgraphs : `~collections.abc.Sequence` [`QuantumGraph` |\
            `~lsst.utils.resources.ResourcePathExpression`]

        Collections to use in `lsst.daf.butler.query_datasets` when testing
        which datasets are available at a high level.
    where : `str`
        A "where" string to use to constrain the datasets; should be provided
        if ``collections`` includes many datasets that are not in any graphs,
        to select just those that might be (e.g. when sharding over dimensions
        and using a final collection that spans multiple shards).
    curse_failed_logs : `bool`
        Mark log datasets as CURSED if they are visible in the final output
        collection. Note that a campaign-level collection must be used here for
        `collections` if `curse_failed_logs` is `True`.

        Whether to read metadata files to get flags that describe qualified
        successes.  If `None`, no metadata files will be read and all
        ``caveats`` fields will be `None`.  If "exhaustive", all metadata files

        """After quantum graphs associated with each run have been added
        to the `QuantumProvenanceGraph, resolve any discrepancies between
        them and use all attempts to finalize overall status.

        Particularly, use the state of each `DatasetRun` in combination with
        overall quantum status to ascertain the status of each dataset.
        Additionally, if there are multiple visible runs associated with a
        dataset, mark the producer quantum as WONKY.

        This method should be called after
        `QuantumProvenanceGraph._add_new_graph` has been called on every graph
        associated with the data processing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        butler : `lsst.daf.butler.Butler`
            The Butler used for this report. This should match the Butler used
            for the run associated with the executed quantum graph.
        collections : `~collections.abc.Sequence` [`str`] | `None`
            Collections to use in `lsst.daf.butler.query_datasets` when testing
            which datasets are available at a high level.
        where : `str`
            A "where" string to use to constrain the datasets; should be
            provided if ``collections`` includes many datasets that are not in
            any graphs, to select just those that might be (e.g. when sharding
            over dimensions and using a final collection that spans multiple
            shards).
        curse_failed_logs : `bool`
            Mark log datasets as CURSED if they are visible in the final
            output collection. Note that a campaign-level collection must be
            used here for `collections` if `curse_failed_logs` is `True`; if
            `_resolve_duplicates` is run on a list of group-level collections
            then each will only show log datasets from their own failures as
            visible and datasets from others will be marked as cursed.
